Fitting Shelves Problem
Given length of wall w and shelves of two lengths m and n, find the number of each type of shelf to be 
used and the remaining empty space in the optimal solution so that the empty space is minimum. The larger 
of the two shelves is cheaper so it is preferred. However cost is secondary and first priority is to minimize 
empty space on wall.

Examples:

Input : w = 24 m = 3 n = 5
Output : 3 3 0
We use three units of both shelves
and 0 space is left.
3 * 3 + 3 * 5 = 24
So empty space  = 24 - 24 = 0
Another solution could have been 8 0 0
but since the larger shelf of length 5
is cheaper the former will be the answer.

Input : w = 29 m = 3 n = 9 
Output : 0 3 2
0 * 3 + 3 * 9 = 27
29 - 27 = 2

A simple and efficient approach will be to try all possible combinations of shelves that fit within the 
length of the wall. To implement this approach along with the constraint that larger shelf costs less than 
the smaller one, starting from 0, we increase no of larger type shelves till they can be fit. For each case 
we calculate the empty space and finally store that value which minimizes the empty space. if empty space is 
same in two cases we prefer the one with more no of larger shelves.
